Here's a list of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations along with their corresponding HTTP status codes commonly used in RESTful APIs:

1. **Create (POST)**:
   - `POST /resource` - Create a new resource
     - **Success Status Codes**:
       - `201 Created`: The resource was successfully created.
       - `202 Accepted`: The request has been accepted for processing, but the creation may not have been completed yet.
     - **Error Status Codes**:
       - `400 Bad Request`: The request is malformed or missing required parameters.
       - `401 Unauthorized`: Authentication is required to create the resource.
       - `403 Forbidden`: The client does not have permission to create the resource.
       - `409 Conflict`: A conflict occurred while creating the resource (e.g., duplicate entry).

2. **Read (GET)**:
   - `GET /resource` - Get all resources
   - `GET /resource/:id` - Get a specific resource by ID
     - **Success Status Codes**:
       - `200 OK`: The request was successful, and the resource(s) are returned.
       - `204 No Content`: The request was successful, but there are no resources to return (e.g., empty list).
     - **Error Status Codes**:
       - `404 Not Found`: The requested resource or ID does not exist.
       - `401 Unauthorized`: Authentication is required to access the resource.
       - `403 Forbidden`: The client does not have permission to access the resource.

3. **Update (PUT or PATCH)**:
   - `PUT /resource/:id` - Update a specific resource by replacing it entirely
   - `PATCH /resource/:id` - Update a specific resource partially
     - **Success Status Codes**:
       - `200 OK`: The resource was successfully updated.
       - `202 Accepted`: The request has been accepted for processing, but the update may not have been completed yet.
     - **Error Status Codes**:
       - `400 Bad Request`: The request is malformed or missing required parameters.
       - `401 Unauthorized`: Authentication is required to update the resource.
       - `403 Forbidden`: The client does not have permission to update the resource.
       - `404 Not Found`: The requested resource or ID does not exist.
       - `409 Conflict`: A conflict occurred while updating the resource.

4. **Delete (DELETE)**:
   - `DELETE /resource/:id` - Delete a specific resource by ID
     - **Success Status Codes**:
       - `204 No Content`: The resource was successfully deleted.
     - **Error Status Codes**:
       - `401 Unauthorized`: Authentication is required to delete the resource.
       - `403 Forbidden`: The client does not have permission to delete the resource.
       - `404 Not Found`: The requested resource or ID does not exist.

These are standard HTTP status codes, and you can use them to convey the outcome of each CRUD operation in your Node.js and Mongoose-based RESTful API. Remember to handle these status codes appropriately in your API's response handlers for better error handling and client communication.
